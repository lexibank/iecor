77,,A,"The traditional etymology ({ref Frisk 1960-1972}, {ref Chantraine 1968–1980}) holds that κρύσταλλος a derivative of κρύος 'cold' (cf. /cognate/1463/).  {ref Beekes 2010}:787) rejects the traditional etymology as a derived noun based on κρύος 'cold' on the basis of the presence of a suffix -αλλο- which he considers a morpheme in Pre-Greek. Certainly, the suffix -αλλο- is derivationally opaque in IE terms, but a comparison of the semantics of κρύος 'cold, frozen' and κρύσταλλος 'ice' is very suggestive of some relationship between the terms. Pace Beekes, it may just as well be that we are be dealing with some sort of lexical contamination of inherited κρύος with some other unknown substrate element. In my own opinion, I think the traditional etymology according to Frisk and Chantraine is probably correct, with a caveat somewhere along these lines. In any case, for the purposes of establishing cognacy in the database this is presently an irrelevant argument, since only the Greek branch attests the disputed element κρύσ(τ)- as the (potentially) semantics-bearing element for in the meaning 'ice'.

1304,,A,"Pace {ref Kroonen 2013}, the different morphology of the Germanic-Italic lexemes on one hand and the Indo-Iranian, and Baltic lexemes on the other does not favour the view that PIE *h₂ekʷ- and *h₂ep- were variants of one another (Martin Kümmel, p.c.). Likewise it is not clear whether the Germanic and Italic lexemes are independent borrowings from a third source (as advocated by {ref Beekes 1998}), but in view of the regular correspondences between Italic and Germanic, gratuitous. Further proposed connections are less certain (cf. {ref EWA 1} 99-103 for a thorough discussion). Less certain is the connection of the Celtic and Anatolian lexemes (cf. discussion in /cognate/1735/). Regarding the Oscan form in this class, an alternative root etymology to PIE *h₂ep- is sometimes considered on the basis of the apparent lengthened root vowel as in the Indo-Iranian forms (e.g. Skt. āp-) cf. {ref Untermann 2000}:42-43, {ref de Vaan 2008}:19), however it is possible that the lengthening of the vowel could be secondary. While it is possible that the Oscan form could preserve an isolated reflex of the root *h₂ep- as found in Indo-Iranian, Baltic, and Tocharian, given that there are no other potential reflexes of the root *h₂ep- in Italic connections with Latin aqua cannot be ruled out, and it seems preferable, on the balance of probability, to connect Oscan <b>aapam</b> with Latin aqua < *h₂ekʷ-(e)h₂ (acknowledged by both Untermann & de Vaan).

2411,,A,"The communis opinio is that the relationship between the lexemes in /cognate/5058/ and /cognate/8269/ have irreconcilable root reconstructions and must be separated into *s⁽k̑⁾eh₂- and *s⁽k̑⁾eh₃-. Cognacy has been thus assigned in this manner according to the main etymological authorities. 

The reconstruction of two separate roots, however crucially hinges on the interpretation of the Greek evidence: Germanic lexemes from PGmc. *skadu- < *s⁽k̑⁾H-tu- appear to be a close parallel formation to Greek σκοτός 'darkness' which reflect earlier *s⁽k̑⁾h₃-tó-.  These are potentially different roots, but this is based entirely on the witness of the Greek evidence.  In any case, the difference is based on disagreement over root-final *h₂ vs. *h₃.  The identity of the laryngeal in σκία < *skh₂-ih₂ is assumed from Att.-Ion. σκηνή, West Greek σκᾱνᾱ́ 'tent' < 'cloth to provide shade' < (transponat) *skeh₂-néh₂ (cf. Beekes 2010, s.v. σκία).  In Ancient Greek does exist another example of a doublet of root-final *h₂ vs. *h₃, namely the dialectal doublet of Attic-Ionic πρῶτος 'first' (ostensibly from *pr̥h₃-to-) against West Greek πρᾶτος 'first' (ostensibly from < *pr̥h₂-to-), cf. Ved. pūrvá- 'first' (formally from *pr̥H-u̯ó-).  One could imagine there may have been some inner-Greek phonological or derivational reason to account for the discrepancy in vocalism.

It seems therefore very possible, in view of the phonological and semantic similarities, that the Tocharian, Greek, Albanian, Indo-Iranian, and Balto-Slavic lexemes in /cognate/5058/ and the Celtic and Germanic lexemes (+Gk. σκότος) in /cognate/8269/ go back to the same root etymology with differing derivational morphology.

3428,606-607,,"""Kangown (AG 165, {ref HAB} II:511) is attested more than a hundred times in the meaning 'cubit' (measure of length), and it is usually inflected as an o-stem (-oy, -ocʻ) though we find two examples of inst.sg. -aw (Ex.26.13) and John 21.8) and one instance of gen.sg. -ean (Esth.7.9). Further kangown is attested twice (2.Sam.7.26 and Is.17.5) in the meaning 'standing'. It is not quite clear to me whether this is a case of accidental homonymy or originally one lexeme. If kangown 'cubit' is to be connected with NP kang 'wing, arm (from the fingertips to the shoulder)' it is difficult to understand the semantic transfer 'standing, upright', so we may consider a derivation from an otherwise extinct verbal stem (kangnel 'stand' is clearly a denominative of kangown). If we are dealing with an inherited word the best candidate may be the active or middle participle of the root continued in Gk. κιχάνω 'reach' < *-n̥u̯-ō (root *g̑ʰeh₁-, cf. also κίχημι, Skt. jahāti 'goes forth' etc.), i.e. -angown < *-n̥u̯-ont- or *-n̥u̯omǝ₁-no-, though the initial k- is troublesome.

However, a phonetically regular reflex should have -olo- then, e.g. Russian **polohoj. A solution is to assume a borrowing from Polish płochy (or a phonetic conforming at the Polish word). However, such a borrowing would be very isolated. Further, the Polish-like form of the root has been attested (in derivatives) already from 14th-15th centuries and it is spread in all East Slavic dialects. Another solution is to assume a contamination with ploskij 'flat'. The probability is disputable. Still another solution is to assume an irregular phonetic change driven or supported by the frequency. The phonetic circumstances are very favourable in this case. The (hipothetical) missing vowel was unstressed and East Slavic stress is dynamic and relatively strong (at least nowadays). Further, it stand between a stop and a liquid. In sequences / pR / there is always a short (prothetic, unphonological) vowel with a quality resembling the next vowel. An unstressed and therefore short, etymological vowel in / pVR / can be very easily interpreted as a prothetic, unphonological vowel articulation (and, in fact, vice versa), especially in cases as *polox- with two identical vowels. Further, we can deal with a dialectal, northern Russian feature in this case which could spread as a lexicalized inter-dialectal borrowing (cf. {ref Zaliznâk 2004}:39-41).

Cognacy has been thus assigned in this manner according to the main etymological authorities. 

The reconstruction of two separate roots, however crucially hinges on the interpretation of the Greek evidence: Germanic lexemes from PGmc. *skadu- < *s⁽k̑⁾H-tu- appear to be a close parallel formation to Greek σκοτός 'darkness' which reflect earlier *s⁽k̑⁾h₃-tó-.  These are potentially different roots, but this is based entirely on the witness of the Greek evidence.  In any case, the difference is based on disagreement over root-final *h₂ vs. *h₃.  The identity of the laryngeal in σκία < *skh₂-ih₂ is assumed from Att.-Ion. σκηνή, West Greek σκᾱνᾱ́ 'tent' < 'cloth to provide shade' < (transponat) *skeh₂-néh₂ (cf. Beekes 2010, s.v. σκία).  In Ancient Greek does exist another example of a doublet of root-final *h₂ vs. *h₃, namely the dialectal doublet of Attic-Ionic πρῶτος 'first' (ostensibly from *pr̥h₃-to-) against West Greek πρᾶτος 'first' (ostensibly from < *pr̥h₂-to-), cf. Ved. pūrvá- 'first' (formally from *pr̥H-u̯ó-).  One could imagine there may have been some inner-Greek phonological or derivational reason to account for the discrepancy in vocalism.

It seems therefore very possible, in view of the phonological and semantic similarities, that the Tocharian, Greek, Albanian, Indo-Iranian, and Balto-Slavic lexemes in /cognate/5058/ and the Celtic and Germanic lexemes (+Gk. σκότος) in /cognate/8269/ go back to the same root etymology with differing derivational morphology.

1. de Vries (1977:495-496) reconstructs Proto-Germanic *skeula-, and considers connections to Gk. σκύλος ‘animal skin’ and its derivative σκυλόω ‘to veil, cover’ (Hesych.), also to OIr. cúl ‘nook, corner’, ultimately a derivative of an IE root *(s)keu- ‘to cover (smth.)’, cf. further Ved. skunā́ti ‘covers’, Lat. obscūrus ‘covered, dark’, Ir. cuarān ‘shoe’.
2. Orel (2003:339) reconstructs Proto-Germanic *skeulan- ~ *skūlan- > ON skjól and considers connections within Germanic to *skuwwōn ‘shadow’ (ON skuggi, etc.), ultimately to IE *(s)k̑eu̯ə- ‘to cover’, comparing Skt. skunā́ti ‘to cover’, Arm. cʻiw ‘roof’, OIr. cúl ‘back’.
To the particular connection with the ‘shadow’ words, there is an additional complication: It is unclear whether the proposed connection to *skuwwōn ‘shadow’ is has the same root etymology. Lehmann (1986:313) indicates two possible etymologies from formally similar roots: either to *(s)kewə-, *(s)kū- (cf. Skt. skunā́ti ‘to cover’, Gk. σκῡ́νια ‘brows’, or to *(s)kew- ‘pay attention to, observe’ (whence also OE scēawian, OS skauwōn, OHG skouwōn = NHG schauen).
LIV² reconstructs the root underlying the ‘see, pay attention to, observe’ words found in NHG schauen, etc. as *(s)keu̯h₁-, which could be formally identical to the proposed root of the ‘hide; shadow’ words found in Germanic *skuwwōn. As the formal similarity exists, it is tempting to consider a single root. Kroonen EDPG, for instance, considers Proto-Germanic *skuwwōn to a basic root *skeu- ‘see’ (without laryngeal).
The common semantic denominator to both proposed forms seems to be whether or not something is visible or not, but it is unclear to me how these opposite meanings can be easily reconciled.
To return to the known facts, Kroonen EDPG does not discuss Norse skjól anywhere and it is unclear to me whether this is an omission due to neglect, or due Kroonen considering this North Germanic lexeme not cognate to anything else in Germanic (and by extension, in Indo-European).
On the formal level, the derivation of skjól is likewise unclear. I do not know of any productive l-stems in Germanic (but this may well be due to my own ignorance).
If the connections to LIV² *(s)keu̯h₁- 'wahrnehmen, schauen' hold, then this lexeme might be cognate with /cognate/5182/ with a root etymology, but due to many uncertainties in semantics and processes of secondary derivation, it is ultimately unclear.

He follows Trépos 1954 instead, who suggested that OBr. staer, ModBr. ster 'river' was borrowed from Latin aestuarium, Vulgar Latin estuarium, esterium 'étier, an inlet, etc., covered by the sea at high tide, tidal opening; a river estuary'. There are no words supporting the alleged Celtic *stagrā in the other Celtic languages. The oldest attestations for OBr ster are the rivernames found in the Cartulaire de Redon (10th or 11th c.) like Stergavale, Stergaule fluvius. In the 13th c., the Cartulaire of Landévennec notes ""an-Staer "" (containing the definite article) as a name of an estate. At the same time, legal documents contain place-names like Banastère (1300-1305), Benester (1300), Beneistier, Benetier (1365), Staerguezel (1366), Lestoer, Listoir (1434). While some of these names render Breton in Old French orthography, others are hybrid forms employing estoir, estier, the Old French continuation of Latin aestuarium. 
OBr. staer has become the word for 'river' in the Modern dialects of Léon, Landéda, a part of Cornouaille and around the Golf of Morbihan. But iits original meaning is broader like in Latin. Regionally, ster means 'river mouth, estuary', 'saltworks' or 'washhouse, washplace'.
